This directory provides the code for a model that estimates the energy consumed in geophones based on packet transmission and reception in our proposed network architecture.
The model is an extension of the IEEE 802.11 DCF based MAC modeling, mainly utilized in determining the duration of packet transmission and reception. 
This is then employed to compute the energy consumed for each packet Tx or Rx based on the hardware radio power consumption specifications.
