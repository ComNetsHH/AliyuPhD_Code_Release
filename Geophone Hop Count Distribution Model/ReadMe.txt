This directory provides the code for a Geophone Hop Count Distribution model that serves as a tool for evaluating and optimizing for some key WSDA challenges distribution of geophones with respect to the proposed WSDA network architecture in the 2.4 and 5 GHz Band. 
The model is based on the configuration in scenario 2 of Section 3.5 in the thesis that estimates the number of hops required by geophones to reach a gateway in the network based on the following inputs or factors:
i). Radio propagation model
ii). Operating frequency
iii). Device antenna specifications
iv). Device transmit power and minimum received power threshold
